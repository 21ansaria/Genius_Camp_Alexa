## Debug Practice 1 

1. Create Skill named 'BPJH_NAME_Debug1' 
2. Open 'SAV.json' and copy 
3. In the ADC, on the left hand side, under slot types, click 'JSON Editor' and REPLACE the code with what you just copied
4. Save Model and everything should update

5. Create the Lambda Function with the same name
