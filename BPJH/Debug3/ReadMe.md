  # It's Time for Debug #3!!

#  Skill Name: Math Challenge

    1. Same instructions as always. Copy and paste Json into front-end and .js into backend 
    2. Twist on debug #3, there will be errors in BOTH the front-end and back-end 
    3. The final skill should ask you for an operation and give you a challenge question based on your response. You should            respond with the answer and Alexa should tell you if you are correct or not. 
    
    Ex. 
        You: “Give me an addition question”
        Alexa: “What is 5 + 7”
        
        You: “The sum is 12” 
        Alexa: “Correct”

# Good luck!!
