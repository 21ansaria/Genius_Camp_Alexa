# Debug 4!! 

This will be our review activity after spring break. 

This is more of an incomplete skill than it is a debugging activity. I have given you the basic format of the skill, your task is to
1. fix the errors 
2. add Multiplication and Division 

Ex. 

User: “Add 3 and 7”

Alexa: “The answer is 10”


## Hint:
      We won't need "If-else" statements in this skill! 
      Errors are in both the front and back end 

### CHALLENGE:

Have Alexa compute for 3 numbers also!

Ex. 

User: Add 5 and 4 and 9 

Alexa: The sum is 18
