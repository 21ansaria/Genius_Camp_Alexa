## Debug 4!! 

This will be our review activity after spring break. 

This is more of an incomplete skill than it is a debugging activity. I have given you the basic format of the skill, your task is to
1. fix the errors 
2. add Multiplication and Division 

Hint: we won't need "If-else" statements in this skill!
