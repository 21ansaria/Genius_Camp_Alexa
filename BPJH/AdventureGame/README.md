## Adventure Game 

For this skill you guys will all be creating your "Choose your own Adventure" type game. 
If you're familiar with Skyrim, it's kind of like that. 

Basically the user gets to make their own choices that determine their ultimate outcome. 

# My Example 

In my example, I have you choose between going to McDonalds or going home. 
Notice how there's more options available, however, I have not coded them. 
So build mine if you want to use at as an example. 

Your task however is to create your OWN adventure game so do not use my story. 
 
# Requirements: 
  
  There should be at least 8 intents (4 different progressions) - in mine I have 2, for my two routes, this is one progression 
  There should be at least 2 different endings. 
  
  Ex. 
  
  Choosing McDonalds and choosing to go home should not lead me to the same ending!
