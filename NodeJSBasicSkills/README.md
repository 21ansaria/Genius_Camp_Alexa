# How do I use these?

## In ADC
After you have created your new skill in the Amazon Developer Console.

Open the model.json file for the respective skill and copy its contents and paste it into the JSON editor.

It will automatically update all the proper fields for you. Just look for the invocation and utterances when you test the skill.

## In AWS
Create a new function and click on blueprints, choose the nodejs factskill template.

Configure/Create and link up endpoints after you added the Alexa Skill Trigger.

Delete the code that was automatically generated and place the code from the respective skill.

### Will it stay like this forever?

Nope. Subject to change.
