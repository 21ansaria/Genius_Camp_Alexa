Summary: Intents, utterances, invocation name, and slots is our “front-end” that goes into the ADC. The lambda code, our “back-end” goes into AWS.

## Lesson 2
### Learning Goal:
SWBAT understand intents and utterances
### Engagement:
Live activity/dialogue
### Instructional Plan:

- Explain: Input into Alexa “triggers” intents
- Demo: Dialogue with Alexa with pre-programmed responses
- Explain: Intents communicate with AWS; intents that exist in AWS don’t have to exist in ADC, but any intent in ADC must exist in AWS
- Activity: Creating multiple intents with 

### Application:
Show Profile Skill //link to in-depth lesson

Adding multiple intents to a skill

### Review:
Flipgrid / response

## Lesson 3
### Learning Goal:
- SWBAT understand slots 
### Engagement:
- Demo: Favorite food intent
- Create a custom slot type

### Instructional Plan:
- Explain: What variables are and how slots relate
- Relating slots to variables used in math, like ‘x’
- {myColor}
- Use Amazon’s color slot type vs. creating a custom color slot type
- Using built-in slot types

### Application:
Create Hello World Memory Skill

## Lesson 4
### Learning Goal:
SWBAT understand attributes 
### Engagement:
- Dialogue: Alexa asks for info, stores it, and regurgitates

### Instructional Plan*:

- Use to store name, favorite color, food

### Application:
Change profile skill to save data and show user at the end

### Review:

## Lesson 5
### Learning Goal:
SWBAT use their knowledge of slots, intents, and utterances to create a skill
