## Debug Practice 1 

1. Create Skill named 'NAME_Debug1' 
2. Open 'SAV.json' and copy 
3. In the ADC, on the left hand side, under slot types, click 'JSON Editor' and REPLACE the code with what you just copied
4. Save Model and everything should update

5. Create the Lambda Function with the same name 
6. Connect Endpoints 
7. Open 'SAV.js' and REPLACE the code like we usually do 

8. Have fund debugging! You will know the code works once you can test your skill and Alexa tells you the story. 


# Hints 

1. Make sure you remember how slots and variables work. 
2. Check to make sure intent/slot names match. 
3. Make sure you know the syntax of an If-else statement. 

You can look back at old codes to compare.
